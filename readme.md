## Tuas Jig Status Tracker

A little tool to track the progress of jig projects – and in the `cert` branch, workshop certifications – in SMRT. Use `meson setup build; ninja -C build; build/window` to compile and run.

The code is heavily inspired by [ToshioCP's GTK4 tutorial](https://github.com/ToshioCP/Gtk4-tutorial).
